# HookMastery: Unleashing the Power of Hooks

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Type-safe state definitions
API Handling

Server-side API route for secure API key usage
Proper error handling
Loading states
Security

API keys stored in environment variables
Server-side API calls to protect keys
Input sanitization (though more could be added)
UI/UX

### Reusable data fetching logic

- State management abstraction
- Error handling
- Development Notes
- The project evolves through multiple versions (0x07 to 0x13), each adding new functionality:

### Basic setup and layout (0x07)

- State management (0x08)
- Environment configuration (0x09)
- API integration (0x10)
- Image tracking (0x11)
- Custom hooks (0x12-0x13)
- The final version demonstrates:

### Clean separation of concerns

- Reusable components and hooks
- Proper TypeScript implementation
- Good React patterns
- For production use, additional features could include:

### User authentication

- Persistent storage of generated images
- More advanced error handling
- Image editing capabilities
- Social sharing features
